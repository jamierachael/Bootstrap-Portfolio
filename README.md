# Bootstrap-Portfolio

This project was designed as a homework assignment for UNH's coding bootcamp. This emphasizes the use of Bootstraps grid design to achieve responsiveness for various screensizes and mobile devices.

This project has been deployed to GitHub Pages. To get this project up and running, you can follow the deployment link. Or, download the sources files to use this as a template.
